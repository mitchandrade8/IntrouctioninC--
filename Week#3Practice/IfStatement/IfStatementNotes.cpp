// MARK: - If Statements:

    /// Conditionals are pieces of code that make a decision about what the program is going to do next. The most 
    ///     common conditional is the if statement.


    // 'If' Statements in C++ must contain the following items:
        // - The keyword 'if'
        // - A boolean expression in parentheses, ().
        // - Curly braces, { }, surrounding all lines of code that will run if the boolean expression is true.

    
    // If Statements:

        // If statements test to see if a certain condition is true. If yes, then specific commands are run. The simple 'if'
        // statement does not do anything if the boolean expressions is false.

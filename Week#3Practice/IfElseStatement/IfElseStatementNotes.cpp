// MARK: - Overview:

    // IF Else Statement Syntax:
        /// The 'If - Else' statement checks to see if a condition is true, and then has specific actions
        /// that take place. However, it also provides a specific set of actions if the boolean expression 
        /// is false. Use the else keyword to introduce the code to run when false is evaluated. Note that else is 
        /// aligned with the if keyword (no identation) and has its own set of curly braces {}. You do not write another 
        /// boolean expression with else.

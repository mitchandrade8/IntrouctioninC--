    // A 'Nested Loop' is a loop that exists inside of another loop. An advantage of using nested loops is that the loops
    // can work together to create unique and complex outputs. 

        // Due to their complexity potential, it is rare to see the implementation of more than two nested loops. 
        // If possible, it is recommended that you refactor your code to reduce this complexity.
